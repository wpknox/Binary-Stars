<h1>Stellar-Evolution-Clustering | User Manual </h1>

  <h2>Home Page</h2>
  <div>
    <p>The home page is the entry point for the application. The home page contains a list of saved user queries. After submitting a query, it is automatically saved to this list.</p>

  <h2>Query Form</h2>
  <div>
    <p>1. The first step when creating a query is selecting the database. Two databases are implemented for this version, COSMIC and POSYDON. </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <p>2. The second step is to select the attributes to cluster with. At least one attribute is required.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      3. Third, attributes can be weighted. The larger the weight of an attribute, the more clustering will consider it.
      The sum of weights must add to 100. Selecting “Allow empty inputs” will evenly weight all attributes.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      4. Fourth, the user can select which clustering algorithm to use. The two algorithms, K-Means and DBScan,
      each have their own pros and cons. More detail is located in the About Page.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      5. Fifth, based on the clustering algorithm selected, users may need to provide additional parameters.
      For example, for K-Means users need to specify the number of clusters.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <p>6. Lastly, users can review all input into the form. When satisfied, the query can be submitted to the backend.</p>

  <h2>Cluster Visualization</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      After a query submission, users can visualize their data with 2D and 3D graphs. The default graph on query submission is the two-attribute display over time.
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="assets/images/help/2_attribute.PNG" alt="Home Page"/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      The user can select different combinations of attributes to display using the configure button. The type of graph can also change.
      The following are possible graphs: One attribute over time on a 2D graph, two attributes over time on a 3D graph, or three attributes
      at single time steps on a 3D graph.
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="assets/images/help/configure.PNG" alt="Home Page" style="width: 20%;"/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>One attribute over time on a 2D graph: </p>
    <img class="image" src="assets/images/help/1_attribute.PNG" alt="Home Page" style="width: 60%;"/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Three attributes at single time steps on a 3D graph:</p>
    <img class="image" src="assets/images/help/3_attribute.PNG" alt="Home Page"/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Users can move the time step up and down to view how clusters change over time (Notice that Timestep has changed from 7 to 8).
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="assets/images/help/3_attribute_with_new_timestep.PNG" alt="Home Page"/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Clusters can be toggled on and off. Other graph tools, such as zooming and highlighting is available in the graph tool bar.
